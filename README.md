<p align="center">The non selected entries will turn to life with colors when selected.<br />
Smaller monitors will also have a Classic Mac OS styled scrollbar when needed.</p>




*Notes*:<br />
I couldn't really get the scrollbar to work exactly as intended for now, seems to be a really buggy feature.<br />
I might take requests for icons etc. if there's interest, we'll see.<br />
Designed with 2.5K monitors in mind, let me know if something doesn't look right at other resolutions.





**<p align="center">Enjoy!</p>**
